# UTranslator: translation tool for Unicodia

A simple program for: a) making original text; b) translating it.

As it is designed for open-source projects, no patch translations here.

**Lifecycle phase: 2** (pre-alpha). Some compileable software that shows what it will be like.

## Why?

Most of Unicodia’s texts are wiki. So it is hard to edit them in marked-up format like XML.

## Installed/portable

To create a portable version, add “portable.rq” file with any content in the same directory as EXE file. It will store config file in EXE directory.
