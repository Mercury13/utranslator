# UTranslator: translation tool for Unicodia

A simple program for: a) making original text; b) translating it.

As it is designed for open-source projects, no patch translations here.

**Lifecycle phase: 3** (alpha). Actually used by people close to developer though not ready for general public. Architecture is obvious.

## Why?

Most of Unicodia’s texts are wiki. So it is hard to edit them in marked-up format like XML.

## Portable version

Set in “UTranslator.xml” file “portable=1”

## Simplified working processes
